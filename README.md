# Line Follower Vehicle 🚗

This project is an Arduino-based robot that follows a black line using infrared (IR) sensors.

## 🔧 Features
- IR sensor-based line tracking
- Motor control for left/right navigation
- Simple Arduino code implementation

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno
- IR sensors
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- Arduino IDE

## 📁 Code
The code is in `azza_case5.ino`.

## 🛠️ How It Works
The robot uses two IR sensors to detect the line. Based on sensor readings:
- If the left sensor sees the line → turn left
- If the right sensor sees the line → turn right
- If both see the line → go straight
